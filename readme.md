## Activity 4.1: Task List Application

This one of a series of coding challenges I've completed while doing a Coding Diploma course with [Itonlinelearning](https://www.itonlinelearning.com/).

### Objective:

The objective of this mini-project is to create a task list application using JavaScript DOM manipulation. This activity aims to provide participants with hands-on experience in building interactive web applications, allowing them to add, remove, and manage tasks dynamically within a webpage interface.
