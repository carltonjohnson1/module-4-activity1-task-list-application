## Activity 4.1: Task List Application

This one of a series of coding challenges I've completed while doing a Coding Diploma course with [Itonlinelearning](https://www.itonlinelearning.com/).

### Objective:

The objective of this mini-project is to create a task list application using JavaScript DOM manipulation. This activity aims to provide participants with hands-on experience in building interactive web applications, allowing them to add, remove, and manage tasks dynamically within a webpage interface.

### Instructions:

1. Setup:

- Create a basic HTML structure with an input field for adding tasks, a button to add tasks, and a container to display the list of tasks.

2. HTML Structure:

- Set up an HTML file with input elements for task input and a button to add tasks.
- Add an unordered list <ul> as a container to display the list of tasks.

3. JavaScript DOM Manipulation:

- Write JavaScript code to handle adding and removing tasks dynamically.
- Define a function to add a new task to the list.
- Customize the content and style of the new task element.
- Append the new task to the task list container.

4. Adding Tasks:

- Implement an event listener on the button element to listen for clicks.
- When the button is clicked, call the function to add a new task to the list.

5. Removing Tasks:

- Add functionality to remove tasks.
- Implement event delegation or attach event listeners to each task for removal.
- Define a function to remove the clicked task from the list.

6. Optional Enhancements:

- Allow users to mark tasks as completed.
- Implement functionality for editing tasks.
- Add styling and animations to enhance the user experience.
